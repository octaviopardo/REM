<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 usWinAscent & usWinDescent.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/family/win_ascent_and_descent](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/family/win_ascent_and_descent)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Are there caret positions declared for every ligature?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard
shortcut.

If designing with UFOs, (as of Oct 2020) ligature carets are not yet compiled
by ufo2ft, and therefore will not build via FontMake. See
googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues/329

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Are there any misaligned on-curve points?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/<Section: Outline Correctness Checks>.html#com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

This test heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, the test also checks for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.

Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design
may call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this test is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, the test will pass if there
are more than 100 reported misalignments.

* ⚠ **WARN** The following glyphs have on-curve points which have potentially incorrect y coordinates:
	* Aringacute: X=666.0,Y=1435.0 (should be at cap-height 1434?)
	* Aringacute: X=666.0,Y=1435.0 (should be at cap-height 1434?)
	* uni018F: X=473.5,Y=1435.0 (should be at cap-height 1434?)
	* Uhorn: X=1742.5,Y=1432.5 (should be at cap-height 1434?)
	* uni1EE8: X=1742.5,Y=1432.5 (should be at cap-height 1434?)
	* uni1EF0: X=1742.5,Y=1432.5 (should be at cap-height 1434?)
